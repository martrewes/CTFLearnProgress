#   CTFLearn - Programming -> Credit Card Fraudster                             #
#   Difficulty: Easy                                                            #

#   Synopsis:                                                                   #
#   I just arrested someone who is probably the most wanted credit card         #
#   fraudster in Europe. She is a smart cybercriminal, always a step ahead      #
#   INTERPOL and she kept unnoticed for years by never buying online, but       #
#   buying goods with a different card every time and in different stores. My   #
#   cyber-analysts found out after collecting all evidences she hacked into one #
#   the largest payment provider in Europe, reverse-engineered the software     #
#   present on the server and partly corrupted the card number validation code  #
#   to accept all her payments. The change enables acceptance of any            #
#   transaction with a card number multiple of 123457 and the Luhn check digit  #
#   is valid.                                                                   #
#                                                                               #
#   I caught her because every year she bought a bouquet of flowers next to the #
#   same cemetery. While handcuffing her at the flower shop's exit, she said    #
#   the flowers were for her lost father and today it is his death anniversary. #
#   She broke down in tears and she did some steps and threw something in the   #
#   sewers. My female colleague conducted a search on her, but she couldn't     #
#   find the card she used, only the receipt.                                   #
#                                                                               #
#   The little flower shop                                                      #
